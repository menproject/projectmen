<div style='text-align: center;'><h1>奇迹边缘 / 𝙈𝙀𝙉</h1></div>

奇迹边缘是一个意在帮助互联网更好地实现其“非盈利”和“公益”性质的开源项目。

奇迹边缘的内容包括，但并不全然限制于向各种文艺创作提供必要的技术支持，以及整合、修改、帮助扩散（当然均按照原有的许可协议）已有的开源作品。在项目发达后，还将逐步向开源社区贡献一些简单的开源软件。奇迹边缘，“边缘”即代表本项目旨在贴近互联网边缘用户（如老年人和青少年用户），因而可能会更加重视于项目的实用化和易用化。同时也代表项目也更侧重于建构更高性能的边缘服务网络。

奇迹边缘，即𝙈𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙙𝙜𝙚 𝙉𝙚𝙩𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠，的另一目的是，希望可以有效提升互联网消灭信息差和普及知识的作用。因而也会开展一系列的知识传递活动。包括但不限于网络公开课和网络自学教程。

𝙈𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙙𝙜𝙚 𝙉𝙚𝙩𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠(𝙈𝙀𝙉) is a open-source project which is set up to help the internet realize its purposes of "non-profit" and "charity".

The parts in 𝙈𝙀𝙉 project includes but not limited in giving the basic technical support to all kinds of creative works, and helping gather, enhance and spread (always under the original license) some open-source softwares. When the project is well-developed, 𝙈𝙀𝙉 will begin to support codes for the open-source community. In the word 𝙈𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙙𝙜𝙚 𝙉𝙚𝙩𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠, the 𝙀𝙙𝙜𝙚 refers to the edge user of the Internet, which is standing for that the project will try its best to get closer to the edge user of the Internet (ex. Elderly and teenagers). So the 𝙈𝙀𝙉 project also focuses on the project's accessbility for edge users. On the other hand (as the other meaning of the word *edge*), the project will also try to improve the edge accessbility for all the users.

Another pupose of setting up the 𝙈𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙙𝙜𝙚 𝙉𝙚𝙩𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠 is to destroy (or may decrease) the difficulty of getting the information and to spread the knowledge. For that reason, the 𝙈𝙀𝙉 project will hold some knowledge-spreading activities too. Such as online open courses and online learning tutorial.
